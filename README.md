🧱 Extension: Workers & Savers

Block 1: Workers  
→ When you use it, it pretends to make your character do a backflip.  
→ It then pretends to play a sound like “BOOM!”  
→ It asks, “What should your game be about?”  
→ It says, “Your game is now starting!”  
→ It pretends to create a background that changes colors.  
→ It shows a fake button that says “🎮 Play Game.”  

Block 2: Savers  
→ It says, “Restoring your game...”  
→ It pretends to restore what was deleted 2 minutes ago.  
→ It beats up the reset block (in your imagination).  
→ It brings everything back like magic.  

Everything here is just text — no real code.  
It’s like reading how the blocks behave instead of making them work.
